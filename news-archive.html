<h1>Website Content</h1>
<p>Hello and welcome to my new (new?) website.
</p>
<p>
I started this website project a few years back, and didn't really get moving with it, after after a year, the renewal cost from <u>namecheap</u> had skyrocketed, so I let the domain name lapse.
<br>As I let the domain name lapse, I also cancelled <u>Amazon's Web Services</u> too.
</p>
<p>So undeterred, I've decided to pick up my old domain name again (i.e <a href="http://ravydavy.co.uk/home.html" target="_blank" title="RavyDavy.co.uk">RavyDavy.co.uk</a>), and just work away at my own pace with updating it, and getting it exactly the way I want it.
</p>
<p>So watch this space for updates.</p>

<h1>Website Content</h1>
<p>Hello and welcome to my new website.
<br>I did hope to have more content up for my website launch, but the weather has been so sunny here in Scotland, that I've enjoyed it over the long weekend; and as a result, my website content has been pushed back.
</p>
<p>Done worry though, I'll be adding content over the next few weeks, and getting my gallery online, check back more more updates</p>

	<h1>Welcome to my New Website</h1>
	<p>Hello and welcome to my new website.
	<br>My name is David, better known on the internet as <a href="http://ravydavy.co.uk" target="_blank" title="My Website">RavyDavy</a>.
	<br>I used to own and maintain a website (RavyDavy.co.uk) from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020928081903/http://www.ravydavy.co.uk:80/" target="_blank" title="archive snapshot of my site in 2002">2002</a> up until around <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090203151417/http://www.ravydavy.co.uk:80/" target="_blank" title="archive snapshot of my site in 2009">2009</a>, then briefly updated it in 2013.
	<br>After this, I let the domain name lapse, and stopped hosting, as the cost was more than I was willing to pay at that time.
	</p>
	<p>Recently, I managed to pick up this Domain Name for less than &#163;1 from <u>namecheap</u>, and for hosting, I've decided to use <u>Amazon Web Service's</u> free S3 hosting.
	</p>
	<p>I will be using this website as a personal website, almost "blog-like", where I can host my extensive picture gallery, but also include any story, or expain the pictures.
	<br>I will also include some of my favourite subject, and interests, which should all be found though my navigation bar at the top of this page.
	</p>
	<p>If you want to contact me, you can contact me on the following email:
