  <h1>And...Another Year!?!</h1>
  <p>Since my last update, I did give Google hosting a go, but the monthly bills were upredictable, and they were higher than I was hoping for.</p>
  <p>I think going forward, I'll be hosting this site on my own GitHub pages, and link here from my Domain, and see how well that works (watch this space).<p>
  <p>A lot has happened since my last update too - I'm in the midst of gearing up to change careers.  I've created a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-mitchell-b1b526252/"target="blank" title="My LinkedIn Bio">LindedIn</a> account, and keep my eyes open on the various jobs websites. I've also been taking various courses, both in <a href="https://www.glasgowclyde.ac.uk/" target="blank" title="Glasgow Clyde College">College</a>, and online, to brush up on various skills.</p>

<h1>A Year Already?</h1>
<p>I just realised that I last updated/worked on this site a year ago - where does the time go?!?
</p>
<p>
During that time, although I did attempt to utilise my Raspberry Pi for webhosting, I didn't find it very intuitive, especially since I would had to remote into it everytime I wanted to update a page.
<br>So I weighed up my various options, and I'm going to give Google's own hosting a try, and see how the costs are.
</p>
<p>More updates coming soon.
